# FeedMe Server - API Documentation
This API designed by Dr. Danny Yellin, supplies CRUD opperations of a restaurant's entities: `dish`, `meal`, `diet`.

## Models
### A dish
Given by its name, which may consist many products.  
On a record creation, the program fetches the dish's information from [api-ninjas](api-ninjas.com/api/nutrition) by the given name, and computes its nutritional values by summing the the nutritional values of the individual products that make up this dish:
- The number of calories
- The serving size (in grams)
- The amount of sodium (in mg)
- The amount of sugar (in grams)  

Each dish resource is expressed by the following JSON object:
```
{
    "name": <string>,
    "ID": <number>,         # positive integer
    "cal": <number>,
    "size": <number>,
    "sodium": <number>,
    "sugar": <number>
}
```  
Example:
```
{
    "name": "focaccia",
    "ID": 2,
    "cal": 251.9,
    "size": 100.0,
    "sodium": 570,
    "sugar": 1.8
}
```

### A meal
Specifes the 3 dish IDs that comprise that meal (appetizer, main, desert).  
On a record creation, the program computes the total nutritional values of that meal by summing those values of the individual dishes that make up the meal.  

Each meal resource is expressed by the following JSON object:
```
{
    "name": <string>,       # name of meal
    "ID": <number>,         # ID of meal
    "appetizer": <number>,  # ID of appetizer dish
    "main": <number>,       # ID of main dish
    "dessert": <number>,    # ID of dessert dish
    "cal": <number>,        # total number of calories in meal
    "sodium": <number>,     # total amount of sodium in meal
    "sugar": <number>       # total amount of sugar in meal
}
```  
Example:
```
{
    "name": "chicken special",
    "ID": 2,
    "appetizer": 3,
    "main": 16,
    "dessert": 15,
    "cal": 812.4,
    "sodium": 1018,
    "sugar": 1.9000000000000001
}
```

- If one of the dishes of the meal changes - the nutritional values of the meal are updated accordingly.
- If one of the dishes are deleted - the appropriate property and all of the nutritional values turn to `JSON-null`
    
    âž¡ Example - say that the `dish` with `ID: 3` which had been set to be the meal's `appetizer` was deleted:
    ```
    {
        "name": "chicken special",
        "ID": 2,
        "appetizer": null,
        "main": 16,
        "dessert": 15,
        "cal": null,
        "sodium": null,
        "sugar": null
    }
    ```

### A diet
Each diet resource is expressed by the following JSON object:
```
{
    "name": <string>,
    "cal": <number>,
    "sodium": <number>,
    "sugar": <number>
}
```
Example:
```
{
    "name": "low sodium",
    "cal": 5000,
    "sodium": 5,
    "sugar": 50
}
```
